## From Skeptic to Evangelist

I will be honest: I fought this initiative.

When corporate announced the UNS rollout, I saw another IT project that would consume my team's bandwidth and deliver PowerPoint slides instead of bottles. Filler Central runs lean—35 assets, two filling lines, and a production team that had built their own workarounds over fifteen years. We did not need a "unified" anything. We needed to hit our numbers.

## The Moment Everything Changed

My skepticism lasted exactly until the first week of live data.

We had always assumed Line 1 was our stronger performer. The operators were more experienced, the equipment was newer, and the maintenance records showed fewer interventions. What UNS revealed was humbling.

Line 2's OEE was consistently 6 points higher.

The difference was in the performance factor—Line 1 was running 12% below standard rate because of a capper timing issue nobody had formally documented. The experienced operators had simply learned to work around it. For years.

## Real Visibility, Real Results

The visibility into our Central Tanks storage area fundamentally changed how we schedule liquid processing. With real-time temperature and weight data from Tank01 through Tank03:

```
Enterprise B/Site2/liquidprocessing/centraltanks/tank01/processdata/process/temperature
Enterprise B/Site2/liquidprocessing/centraltanks/tank01/processdata/process/weight
```

We eliminated the "walk and check" routine that consumed 90 minutes per shift. More importantly, we catch thermal drift before it impacts product quality. Last quarter, we avoided two batch holds that would have cost us 40,000 units each.

## The Conversion

What converted me completely was traceability.

When our labeler on the Left Line tagged the wrong SKU on a promotional run, we isolated the affected lot numbers within minutes instead of hours. The rework cost was contained to 2,100 cases instead of the entire production day.

I was wrong. The data does not lie.

Now I cannot imagine running this plant without it. Filler Central is proof that even old dogs can learn new tricks when the evidence is undeniable.
