## Executive Summary

### What is the Unified Namespace?

The Unified Namespace (UNS) is a single, organized structure that contains all operational data from Enterprise C's bioprocessing operations. Think of it as a filing system where every piece of equipment, every sensor reading, every batch phase, and every operator acknowledgment has a specific, predictable address.

Instead of navigating multiple DCS screens, batch historians, and SCADA systems to find data, the UNS gives you one consistent way to access everything.

**Before UNS:**
- "Where do I find the bioreactor dissolved oxygen? Is it in DeltaV? The batch historian? The paper batch record?"

**With UNS:**
- `Enterprise C/sub/AIC-250-001_PV_percent`

Every data point has a clear, logical path that follows your process train's structure.

### Who Should Use This Documentation?

| Role | What You'll Use This For |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Bioprocess Engineers** | Monitor fermentation parameters, analyze batch deviations, optimize process setpoints |
| **Manufacturing Operators** | Check equipment status, respond to operator prompts, verify batch phases |
| **Quality/Validation Engineers** | Trace batch context, verify GMP compliance, investigate deviations |

### What Data is Available?

The UNS provides access to four categories of data across 4 process skids:

| Data Category | What It Contains | Example Questions It Answers |
|---------------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Batch Context** | Recipe, Phase, State, Batch ID, Formula | "What phase is the bioreactor in?" "What batch is running?" |
| **Process Variables** | Temperature, pH, DO, Pressure, Flow, Conductivity, UV | "What's the bioreactor DO?" "What's the TFF transmembrane pressure?" |
| **Control Data** | Setpoints, Outputs, Modes, Valve States | "What's the agitator speed setpoint?" "Is the transfer valve open?" |
| **Operator Prompts** | Acknowledgments, Verification Steps | "Has the operator acknowledged the media addition?" |

```

**Total:** 1 Enterprise | 4 Process Units | 189 Tags | Single Product Train

> **Key Difference from Enterprise A/B:** Enterprise C uses a **flat hierarchy** (Enterprise -> Device -> Tags) rather than the Site/Area/Line/Equipment structure used in discrete manufacturing. This reflects the batch-centric nature of bioprocessing where process units operate as integrated systems.

---

## Semantic Foundations

### ISA-95 Hierarchy Alignment

Enterprise C uses a simplified, flat hierarchy aligned with ISA-95 but adapted for batch bioprocessing:

| UNS Level | ISA-95 Role | Term | Definition |
|-----------|-------------|------|------------|
| 1 | Enterprise | **Enterprise** | The top-level organizational entity (Enterprise C) |
| 2 | Process Cell | **Device** | Individual process skids/units (chrom, sub, sum, tff) |
| 3 | - | **Tag** | Individual measurements, setpoints, and control values |

> **Note:** Unlike Enterprise A (glass manufacturing) and Enterprise B (beverage filling), Enterprise C does not use intermediate Site, Area, or Line levels. The flat structure reflects how bioprocessing skids operate as self-contained process cells within a single facility.

### ISA-88 Batch Control Alignment

Enterprise C follows ISA-88 (S88) procedural control model for batch manufacturing:

| S88 Concept | UNS Implementation | Example |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Recipe** | `RECIPE` tag | PR_SUB_PROC, PR_SUM_MEDIA, PROC, PROCESS |
| **Formula** | `FORMULA` tag | rBMN-42 (the product being manufactured) |
| **Procedure** | Recipe execution | The complete batch operation |
| **Unit Procedure** | Phase sequences | Fermentation, Purification |
| **Phase** | `PHASE` tag | PH_SUB_FEED2, FLUSH, PH_SUM_XFR |
| **State** | `STATE` tag | Running, Idle, Complete, Holding |
| **Batch ID** | `BATCH_ID` tag | Unique batch identifier |

### Hierarchy Relationships

The UNS uses a direct containment model:

```
Enterprise ──contains──> Device ──contains──> Tags
```

| Relationship | How It's Expressed | Example |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Enterprise | Root namespace | Enterprise C |
| Process Unit | Device segment | sub (bioreactor), chrom (chromatography) |
| Measurement | Tag name | AIC-250-001_PV_percent (dissolved oxygen) |

### Bioprocessing Process Flow

Understanding the process flow helps you navigate the UNS:

```
Media Prep --> Inoculation --> Cell Culture --> Harvest --> Purification --> Concentration
    |              |              |               |             |                |
  SUM500       UNIT-250        UNIT-250       UNIT-250       CHR01           TFF300
    |              |              |               |             |                |
 PR_SUM_MEDIA  PR_SUB_PROC    PR_SUB_PROC    PR_SUB_PROC     PROC           PROCESS
```

---

## Quick Start Guide

### Your First Query in 3 Steps

**Goal:** Find the current dissolved oxygen (DO) in the 250L bioreactor

**Step 1: Start with the Enterprise**
```
Enterprise C/
```

**Step 2: Add the device**
```
Enterprise C/sub/
```

**Step 3: Add the specific tag**
```
Enterprise C/sub/AIC-250-001_PV_percent
```

That's it. This path gives you the real-time dissolved oxygen value (currently ~31.44%).

### Understanding the Path Structure

Every UNS path follows this pattern:

```
{Enterprise} / {Device} / {Tag}
      |            |         |
      |            |         +-- The specific measurement with units
      |            +-- Process unit (sub, chrom, sum, tff)
      +-- Enterprise C
```

### Device Short Names

| Short Name | Full Equipment Name | Description |
|------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `sub` | UNIT-250 | 250L Bioreactor (Upstream) |
| `chrom` | CHR01 | Chromatography Skid |
| `sum` | SUM500 | 500L Media Preparation |
| `tff` | TFF300 | Tangential Flow Filtration |

> **Tip:** Device names in paths use the short codes (sub, chrom, sum, tff), not the full equipment names.

---

## Common Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Operator Checking Bioreactor Status

**Situation:** You need to verify the bioreactor is operating within normal parameters during the feed phase.

**Paths to query:**

| Metric | Path | Expected Value |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Dissolved Oxygen | `Enterprise C/sub/AIC-250-001_PV_percent` | 30-35% |
| pH | `Enterprise C/sub/AIC-250-003_PV_pH` | 5.3-5.5 |
| Temperature | `Enterprise C/sub/TIC-250-001_PV_Celsius` | 29.5-30.5 C |
| Agitator Speed | `Enterprise C/sub/SIC-250-008_PV_RPM` | 400-420 RPM |
| Vessel Weight | `Enterprise C/sub/WI-250-001_PV_kg` | ~200 kg |
| Current Phase | `Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_PHASE` | PH_SUB_FEED2 |
| Batch State | `Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_STATE` | Running |

**Normal operating values for PH_SUB_FEED2 phase:**
- DO: 30-35% (cascade controlled)
- pH: 5.3-5.5 (controlled via base addition)
- Temperature: 29.5-30.5 C (jacket controlled)
- Agitator: 400-420 RPM
- State: Running

---

### Scenario 2: Engineer Investigating Batch Deviation

**Situation:** Quality reported a deviation in a batch. You need to trace the process conditions.

**Step 1: Verify batch context**

| Data Point | Path |
|------------|------|
| Batch ID | `Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_BATCH_ID` |
| Recipe | `Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_RECIPE` |
| Formula | `Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_FORMULA` |
| Current Phase | `Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_PHASE` |

**Step 2: Check critical process parameters**

For bioreactor deviations:

| Parameter | PV Path | SP Path |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| DO | `.../sub/AIC-250-001_PV_percent` | `.../sub/AIC-250-001_SP_percent` |
| pH | `.../sub/AIC-250-003_PV_pH` | `.../sub/AIC-250-003_SP_pH` |
| Temperature | `.../sub/TIC-250-001_PV_Celsius` | `.../sub/TIC-250-001_SP_Celsius` |

**Step 3: Check downstream if harvest is complete**

If investigating purification:

| Parameter | Path | What It Indicates |
|-----------|------|-------------------|
| CHR01 UV | `.../chrom/CHR01_AT003_PV` | Protein breakthrough |
| CHR01 Conductivity | `.../chrom/CHR01_AT002_PV` | Buffer conditions |
| CHR01 Phase | `.../chrom/CHR01_PHASE_PV` | Current step |

---

### Scenario 3: Building a Process Monitoring Dashboard

**Situation:** Operations wants a dashboard showing the entire process train status.

**Critical parameters by unit:**

**SUM500 (Media Prep):**
```
Enterprise C/sum/TIC501-PV_Celsius      -- Temperature

Enterprise C/sub/TIC-250-001_PV_Celsius   -- Temperature
Enterprise C/sub/SIC-250-008_PV_RPM       -- Agitator speed
Enterprise C/sub/WI-250-001_PV_kg         -- Vessel weight
Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_PHASE           -- Current phase
Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_STATE           -- Equipment state
```

**CHR01 (Chromatography):**
```
Enterprise C/chrom/CHR01_AT003_PV         -- UV absorbance
Enterprise C/chrom/CHR01_AT001_PV         -- pH
Enterprise C/chrom/CHR01_AT002_PV         -- Conductivity
Enterprise C/chrom/CHR01_FT001_PV         -- Flow rate
Enterprise C/chrom/CHR01_PHASE_PV         -- Current phase
```

**TFF300 (Filtration):**
```
Enterprise C/tff/TMP7M_psig               -- Transmembrane pressure
Enterprise C/tff/CI8R_mS/cm               -- Conductivity
Enterprise C/tff/UV8R_AU                  -- UV absorbance
Enterprise C/tff/phase                    -- Current phase
```

---

### Scenario 4: Tracing Batch Through Process Train

**Situation:** You need to follow a batch from media prep through final concentration.

**Query batch context at each unit:**

| Unit | Batch ID Path | Phase Path | State Path |
|------|---------------|------------|------------|
| SUM500 | `.../sum/BATCH_ID` | `.../sum/PHASE_ID` | `.../sum/SUM500-STATUS` |
| UNIT-250 | `.../sub/UNIT-250_BATCH_ID` | `.../sub/UNIT-250_PHASE` | `.../sub/UNIT-250_STATE` |
| CHR01 | `.../chrom/CHR01-BATCH-ID` | `.../chrom/CHR01_PHASE_PV` | `.../chrom/CHR01_STATE_PV` |
| TFF300 | `.../tff/TFF300-BATCH-ID` | `.../tff/phase` | (see phase) |

**Expected phase progression:**

| Unit | Typical Phases | Duration |
|------|----------------|----------|
| SUM500 | PH_SUM_PREP -> PH_SUM_MIX -> PH_SUM_XFR | 4-6 hours |
| UNIT-250 | PH_SUB_INOC -> PH_SUB_GROWTH -> PH_SUB_FEED1 -> PH_SUB_FEED2 -> PH_SUB_HARVEST | 5-7 days |
| CHR01 | EQUILIBRATE -> LOAD -> WASH -> ELUTE -> STRIP -> CIP -> FLUSH | 8-12 hours per step |
| TFF300 | SETUP -> CONCENTRATE -> DIAFILTRATION -> FINAL -> CIP | 6-10 hours |

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "I can't find data for my equipment"

1. **Check the device code:** Use short names
   - Wrong: `Enterprise C/UNIT-250/...`
   - Correct: `Enterprise C/sub/...`

2. **Verify the path structure:**
   - Wrong: `EnterpriseC/sub/AIC101_DO_PV`
   - Correct: `Enterprise C/sub/AIC-250-001_PV_percent`

3. **Check tag naming with units:**
   - Tags include engineering units: `_PV_percent`, `_Celsius`, `_RPM`

### "The DO value seems wrong"

- DO is expressed as % saturation (0-100%), not mg/L
- Typical operating range during fed-batch: 25-40%
- Check AIC-250-001_SP_percent to confirm setpoint

### "Where do I find batch context?"

Batch context tag names vary by device:
```
Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_BATCH_ID
Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_PHASE
Enterprise C/sub/UNIT-250_STATE

Enterprise C/sum/BATCH_ID
Enterprise C/sum/PHASE_ID
Enterprise C/sum/SUM500-STATUS

Enterprise C/chrom/CHR01-BATCH-ID
Enterprise C/chrom/CHR01_PHASE_PV
Enterprise C/chrom/CHR01_STATE_PV

Enterprise C/tff/TFF300-BATCH-ID
Enterprise C/tff/phase
```

### "What do the phase codes mean?"

| Device | Phase Pattern | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| sub | PH_SUB_* | PH_SUB_FEED2 = Feed phase 2 |
| sum | PH_SUM_* | PH_SUM_XFR = Transfer phase |
| chrom | Step names | LOAD, WASH, ELUTE, FLUSH |
| tff | Step names | CONCENTRATE, DIAFILTRATION, IDLE |

### "How do I know if a valve is open?"

Query the valve tag directly:
```
Enterprise C/sub/HV-250-001_PV
```
Returns: `OPEN` or `CLOSED`

### "Why is there no OEE data?"

Enterprise C is batch-centric, not OEE-focused. Performance is measured by:
- Batch cycle time vs. standard
- Product yield (measured offline)
- Phase duration against recipe targets
- Right-first-time metrics
